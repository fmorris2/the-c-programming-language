/*
*	Exercise 1-21
*		Write a program "entab" that replaces strings of blanks by
*		the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same
*		spacing. Use the same tab stops as for "detab". When either
*		a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop,
*		which should be given preference?
*
*	Personal Note
*		When either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach
*		a tab stop, a tab should be given preference. The reason for
*		this is so that the code remains consistent in intent. We're
*		"encoding" the input with tabs, so we should remain consistent
*		in that mission.
